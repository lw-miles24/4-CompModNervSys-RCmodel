        "Neurons are constantly receiving inputs of different strength and timing that encode various types of information. In order to generate an action potential and transmit information to downstream neurons, those inputs need to cross the action potential threshold. In our *passive* RC model, we haven't included any action potential generation mechanisms and right now, we've just included an artificial current stimulus. This is a good model of how we might inject currents experimentally, and it can work as a decent model of synaptic input for now. We'll see later on it doesn't replicate the nonlinearity of synaptic conductances, which may serve as an important computational tool within single neurons. \n",

In order for two (or more) synaptic inputs to a neuron sum together and produce an output (e.g., an action potential), they need to occur close enough in time. How close in time this needs to be is determined by the time constant of the neuronal membrane. What you may have noticed above is the time for the neuron to charge to steady state is defined by the time constant, where $\\tau_m$ is the time to reach 63.2% of steady state ($1 - 1/e$), but, the time to *discharge* is also defined by the time constant. Critically, this will determine how closely spaced in time inputs need to be in order for them to sum and activate a neuron. Let's explore this idea below. \n",
